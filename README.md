# eigthies-workoutsite

This personal project let me practice my web development skills as well as my dance moves.

## Idea
This idea came from a personal frustration, as I had to dive into the depths of the internet to find good quality eighties' workout videoâ€™s. I decided to build a website to collect my finds and make them easily accessible to others.

## Approach
This site continues to grow together with my skills. The first version was build with some basic HTML and CSS knowledge. Over time, I created version 2 (responsive) and version 3 (new design and improved responsiveness).

## Challenges
The main challenge of this website was deciding on the design and color scheme, as the eighties can be a bit...well, colorful.

## Room to improve
Next to more content, I plan to purchase a domainname and improve the SEO of the page. This will enable people to find the page and kick those feet up.
